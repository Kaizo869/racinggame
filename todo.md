# Three.js Car Racing Game Development

## Game Features and Requirements
- [x] Define player controls (keyboard input for acceleration, braking, steering)
- [x] Design 3D car model with detailed textures
- [x] Create race track with curves, straights, and terrain features
- [x] Implement physics for car movement and collision detection
- [x] Add lap counting and timing system
- [x] Include obstacles and track boundaries
- [x] Design visual effects (particle effects, lighting, shadows)
- [x] Implement camera following mechanics
- [ ] Add sound effects for engine, collisions, and environment
- [x] Create HUD for speed, lap time, and position

## 3D Models and Assets
- [x] Design low-poly car model suitable for web performance
- [x] Create track environment with varied terrain
- [x] Design skybox for immersive environment
- [x] Create textures for car, track, and environment

## Gameplay Mechanics
- [x] Implement car physics (acceleration, braking, steering)
- [x] Add collision detection and response
- [x] Create lap counting system
- [x] Implement race timing functionality
- [x] Add game states (start, racing, finish)

## Graphics Enhancements
- [x] Implement dynamic lighting and shadows
- [x] Add particle effects for tire smoke, exhaust
- [x] Create post-processing effects (motion blur, bloom)
- [x] Optimize for performance while maintaining visual quality

## Testing and Refinement
- [x] Test gameplay mechanics and physics
- [x] Verify visual quality and performance
- [x] Refine controls for better user experience
- [x] Ensure cross-browser compatibility

## Delivery
- [x] Package all code and assets
- [x] Create documentation for game controls
- [x] Provide final code to user
